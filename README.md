The reason for this project was for me to showcase my AWS foundational knowledge. I leveraged route 53 to reserve a domain name, and used S3 to host a static website.

Steps:
  1. Reserve a domain name using Route 53
  2. Create a S3 bucket
  3. Upload website files
  4. Configure bucket policy
  5. Enable website hosting
  6. Route traffic with Route 53 from S3 to desired domain name
