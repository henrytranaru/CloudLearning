    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Henry! I’m passionate about technology and driven by curiosity to keep learning and growing in the ever-evolving world of IT. My interests lie especially in cloud computing and cybersecurity, where I enjoy diving deeper into how systems work, how they can be optimized, and how they can be secured.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Tier 2 End User Support Specialist, where I’ve gained hands-on experience with computer imaging, Active Directory, Intune, and troubleshooting across Windows and iOS environments. Along the way, I’ve also earned certifications including CompTIA Security+, ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity, and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, with plans to continue expanding my knowledge through additional certifications and projects.</p>

<p>I built this website as a place to showcase my skills, projects, and certifications, but more importantly, as a reflection of my dedication to becoming a better IT professional every day. My goal is to grow into roles within cloud engineering or cybersecurity, where I can apply my problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, and eagerness to keep learning.</p>
    <p>This site showcases my resume, technical projects, and certifications.</p>
